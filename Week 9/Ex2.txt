To increase Hit/Miss ratio, 
we can request the same page reference multiple consecutive times which will result into an increase of hits.
Example: 1 1 1 1 1 1 : 5 hits, 1 miss (ratio-> 5:1)

To decrease Hit/Miss ratio, 
we can request many different references with small repetitions as possible which will result into a decrease in hits.
Example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 : 0 hits, 6 misses (ratio-> 0:6)
